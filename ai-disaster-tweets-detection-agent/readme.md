# AI Disaster Tweets Detection Agent

This project benchmarks different AI agent frameworks for disaster tweet classification. It uses a hybrid approach combining Machine Learning (ML) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect disaster-related tweets. 

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Omdena and can be accessed at:
[Omdena Datasets](https://datasets.omdena.com/dataset/twitter-data-on-disaster-related-tweets)

The goal is to evaluate inference speed and accuracy across frameworks.
