AI Disaster Tweets Detection Agent Benchmark

This project benchmarks different AI agent frameworks for disaster tweet classification. It uses a hybrid approach combining Machine Learning (ML) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect disaster-related tweets. 

The goal is to evaluate inference speed and accuracy across frameworks.
